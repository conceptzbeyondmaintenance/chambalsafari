                                Large numbers of indigenous trees and shrubs are planted every year to supplement the existing growth and to create a nature reserve that is being progressively allowed to regenerate itself, untouched by
                                human interference. The results of our efforts can be judged by the fact that the Lodge area now boasts of a checklist of over 198 species of birds, reptiles and mammals.

                            <li>Have helped create check-dams in the ravines and also created large ponds for collecting and storing rainwater in and around the Lodge area, for recharging groundwater reservoirs.</li>
